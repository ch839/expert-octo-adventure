 bjlhkgkghhlhgWe only have to run those commands for setting up the connection to Github once. What are the commands that we will mostly use in our workflow now that everything is set up?

Start by making some changes. Open your README.md and change the text so that it displays a different message.

Run a command to add these changes to the staging area. Then run a different command to check if that file was staged.

Run a command that creates a new commit.

Push this new commit from your local machine to Github.

Refresh your Github page again and your README.md text changes should display.
